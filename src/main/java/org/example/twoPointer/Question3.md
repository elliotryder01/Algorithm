🧠 Two Pointers #3: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
LeetCode #26

📘 Problem Statement:

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once.
The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Return the number of unique elements in nums, and modify nums in-place so that the first k elements contain the unique values.

❗You must not allocate extra space for another array — do this in O(1) space.
✳️ Example:

Input:
nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]

Output:
5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,...]
(The remaining values don’t matter after the first 5)

🔒 Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 × 10⁴
-100 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order
