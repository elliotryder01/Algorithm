**🧠 Problem: Two Sum II – Input Array Is Sorted**

**📘 Problem Statement:**

You are given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
Your task is to find two numbers such that they add up to a given target.

Return the indices of the two numbers as a 1-based integer array.

⚠️ You must not use the same element twice.
✅ Your solution must use constant extra space and run in O(n) time.


**✳️ Example:**

**Input:** numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9  

**Output:** [1, 2]  → because 2 + 7 = 9

**🚫 Constraints:**
You must use constant extra space

You must use the two-pointer technique, not brute force
