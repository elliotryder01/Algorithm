üß† Problem: Remove Element

Prompt:

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in-place. The order of the elements may change. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Do not allocate extra space for another array ‚Äî you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

‚ú® Example 1

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3  
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]

Explanation: The function should return 2, and the first two elements of nums should be 2s. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

‚ú® Example 2

Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2  
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]

üõ†Ô∏è Constraints

0 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 50
0 <= val <= 100
