🌧️ Trapping Rain Water

Problem:
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6

Explanation:

Visualize it as bars of different heights. Water gets trapped between taller bars with shorter bars in the middle.

💡 Your Goal:

Write a method int trap(int[] height) that returns the total amount of trapped rainwater.
Use the two-pointer technique (no stacks for now).
Try to do it in O(n) time and O(1) space.
Let me know once you give it a shot or if you want hints along the way.
