🧠 Two Pointers #4: Sorted Squared Array
(Also known as: “Squares of a Sorted Array”)

📘 Problem Statement:

Given a sorted array nums of integers — which may include negative numbers — return a new array of the squares of each number, also sorted in non-decreasing order.

✳️ Example:

Input:
nums = [-7, -3, 2, 3, 11]

Output:
[4, 9, 9, 49, 121]

🔒 Constraints:

Array is already sorted
But squaring values can mess up the order (because of negatives)
