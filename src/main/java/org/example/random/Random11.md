"Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters, and return the sorted string."

ðŸ§ª Example:

Input:  s = "tree"
Output: "eert"

Explanation: 'e' appears twice, 'r' and 't' once. So 'e' comes first.

Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc" or "cccaaa"

Explanation: Both are valid. 'c' and 'a' appear 3 times each.
