You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character in the string and change it to any other character — but you can do this at most k times.
Return the length of the longest substring that contains the same letter you can get after at most k replacements.


Example:

Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4

Explanation: Replace 2 "B" with "A" → "AAAA"
